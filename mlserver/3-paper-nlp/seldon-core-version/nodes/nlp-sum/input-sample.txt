He came to appreciate that its breadth and depth provide a wonderful ballast to stabilize the body and mind in the fast and technology-oriented lifestyle of today; yoga is an antidote to stress and a path to a better understanding of oneself and others. He is a RYT 500 certified yoga instructor of the YogaWorks program and has trained with contemporary masters, including Maty Ezraty, co-founder of YogaWorks and master instructor of the Iyengar and Ashtanga traditions, as well as a specialization with Mr. Bernie. Clark, a master instructor of the Yin tradition. His courses reflect these traditions, where he combines the fundamental basis of a precise alignment with elements of balance and concentration. These intertwine to help provide a way to cultivate a consciousness of yourself, others and the world around you, as well as to create a self-evident refuge against the physical style of life. He's just doing the right thing for himself. He's doing the right thing for himself. He's doing the right thing for himself. He's doing the right thing for himself. He's doing the right thing for himself. He's doing the right for the right thing for the right now. He's doing the right thing for the right now. He's doing the right for the right now. He's doing the right for the right for the right for the right for the right thing for the right for the right for the right for the right for the right thing for the right for the right thing. He's for the right for the right for the right thing."}}
